## Why Education Matters

Education is a powerful tool that can transform lives. Here are some key reasons why education is important:

- **Higher Earning Potential**: On average, bachelor’s degree holders earn 40% more over a lifetime than high school graduates.
- **Better Job Security**: College graduates have significantly lower unemployment rates.
- **Career Growth**: Many emerging fields (e.g., technology, healthcare) prefer or require a college degree.
- **Improved Quality of Life**: Educated individuals often have better health, increased civic participation, and greater life satisfaction.

“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” — Nelson Mandela
